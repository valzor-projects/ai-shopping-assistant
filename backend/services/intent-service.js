Classify the user message into exactly one of these intents:
- "product_search": user is looking for a product, asking about products, wants recommendations, mentions a product category, material, use case, or describes what they want
- "price_filter": user mentions a budget, price range, "under X", "below X", "cheap", "affordable", "expensive", "luxury"
- "greeting": user says hi, hello, hey, thanks, bye, or makes small talk
- "store_info": user asks about shipping, returns, store policies, payment methods
- "off_topic": anything not related to shopping or products (politics, coding, recipes, sports, etc.)

Also extract:
- "corrected_query": the user's message with ALL spelling mistakes and typos fixed, grammar corrected. If no typos, return the original.
- "budget": if a price/budget is mentioned, extract the number. Otherwise null.
- "category": if a product category is clearly mentioned, extract it (electronics/clothing/accessories/jewelry/home/fragrance). Otherwise null.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON:
{
  "intent": "product_search|price_filter|greeting|store_info|off_topic",
  "corrected_query": "...",
  "budget": null or number,
  "category": null or "string"
